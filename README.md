# Multiple Stressor Impacts

This repository contains the **regression metadata**, the **174 paired-stressor response datasets** as well as the **R-code** used in the study:

*Birk et al. 2020.* Impacts of multiple stressors on freshwater biota across spatial scales and ecosystems. *Provisionally accepted in Nat. Ecol. Evol.*

Folder *Data* includes
1. the **regression metadata** as *semicolon-separated values* and the *readme* specifying the column-headers;
2. the **174 paired-stressor response datasets** as *semicolon-separated values* and the *readme* specifying the column-headers.

Folder *R-script* includes
1. the **R-code** (*cleancode.R*) used to analyse the paired-stressor response datasets, and
2. the related **R-functions** (*functions.R*) embedded in the R-code.
